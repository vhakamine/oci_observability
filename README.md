Repository for OCI Observability Automations

We are focused on providing automation tools for observability on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Our goal is to make it easier for users to monitor and troubleshoot their OCI environments by providing scripts and templates that automate the deployment of observability solutions.

With our repository, you can quickly and easily set up monitoring and logging for your OCI resources, helping you to optimize performance and troubleshoot issues more efficiently.

We hope you find our tools useful and we welcome any feedback or contributions to the repository.
